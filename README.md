Assignment: Multilevel Inheritance in Python
This program demonstrates multilevel inheritance using three classes: Person, Student, and Exam. The inheritance chain is:
Person → Student → Exam
(a) Person Class
The Person class is the base class. It stores the attributes - name and age, and provides a method to display them.
(b) Student Class
The Student class inherits from Person and adds a new attribute called course. It includes a method to display the course name.
(c) Exam Class
The Exam class inherits from Student. It stores marks of three subjects and calculates the total marks. It also displays all the marks and the total.
(d) Object Creation
An object of the Exam class is created using sample data. The program calls all display methods to show complete information, including personal details, course, marks, and total marks.
